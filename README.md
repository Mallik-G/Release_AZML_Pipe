This repo uses path based filtering for build triggers.  

All source code regardless of language roots in src, where individual repos are under src.

When editing code to work with VSCode and unit testing, it is expected that you open at the root of the "micro-solution".  For example, the Distributed Package is a "micro-solution" as is the "Inference Pipeline". 

Deploy_environment is a set of ordered powershell scripts which can be used to fully automate the deployment.
